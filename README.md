# Nonverbal-Behaviors-Detection
Detection of nonverbal behavior cues like blinking, gaze aversion, nodding, head shaking, smile and so on

The code here is mainly for the detection of human's nonverbal behaviors. Their functions are as follows:

1. Blinking.py : detecting blinking in realtime, and counting the times of blinking;
2. Headpose.py : detecting the status of head pose, including nodding and head shaking;
3. Gaze_aversion.py : tracking the motion of eye and determine the directions of eyes;
4. Smiling.py: detecting if a smile has occurred;
5. main.py : mian function.

* run all code:
python main.py

* run separately:
At the end of each piece of code above(except main.py),uncomment the code after #-------separate test------, you can run each piece of code solely.
